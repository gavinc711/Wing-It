Wing It is a project that a couple classmates and I did for a college course, where we were meant to code a game with a small team. 
I was the main programmer and carried the framework over from another project I had left over from a different class, meaning a lot of the game's code functionality and scripting, especially when it came to the main game loop, was sourced from me.
